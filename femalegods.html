                <h2>Hera</h2>
                <p>Hera (Roman name: Juno), wife of Zeus and queen of the 
                    ancient Greek gods, represented the ideal woman and was 
                    goddess of marriage and the family. However, she was perhaps 
                    most famous for her jealous and vengeful nature, principally 
                    aimed against the lovers of her husband and their 
                    illegitimate offspring. Hera herself was notable as one of 
                    the very few deities that remained faithful to her partner 
                    and she therefore came to symbolise monogamy and fidelity.

                <h2>Athena</h2>
                <p>Goddess of wisdom, war and the crafts, and favourite daughter 
                    of Zeus, Athena was, perhaps, the wisest, most courageous,
                    and certainly the most resourceful of the Olympian gods.

                <h2>Artemis</h2>
                <p>Artemis was the Greek goddess of hunting, wild nature, and 
                    chastity. The daughter of Zeus and sister of Apollo, Artemis 
                    was regarded as a patron of girls and young women and a 
                    protectress during childbirth. She was worshipped across 
                    the Greek world, but her most famous cult site was as a 
                    fertility goddess at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one 
                    of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. To the Romans, 
                    the goddess was known as Diana.</p>

            <div id="demeter">
                <h2>Demeter</h2>
                <p>Demeter was one of the oldest gods in the ancient Greek pantheon,
                    and she guaranteed the fertility of the earth and protected 
                    both farming and vegetation. This close connection with the 
                    earth was inherited from her mother Rhea, and doubtless, she 
                    was a reincarnation of local mother Earth goddesses, commonly
                    worshipped in rural communities in the Bronze Age. The 
                    sanctuary at Eleusis dedicated to the goddess and her daughter 
                    Persephone and the Eleusinian Mysteries practised there spread
                    the idea across the Archaic and Classical Greek worlds that 
                    Demeter would protect her worshippers in the afterlife. To 
                    the Romans, the goddess remained popular and was known as Ceres.</p>

            <div id="aphrodite">
                <h2>Aphrodite</h2>
                <p>Ancient Greek goddess of love, beauty, desire, and all aspects 
                    of sexuality, Aphrodite could entice both gods and men into 
                    illicit affairs with her good looks and whispered sweet nothings. 
                    Born near Cyprus from the severed genitalia of the sky god Uranus, 
                    Aphrodite had a much wider significance than the traditional view 
                    as a mere goddess of love and sex. Worshipped by men, women, and 
                    city-state officials, she also played a role in the commerce, 
                    warfare, and politics of ancient Greek cities. In addition, Aphrodite 
                    was honoured as a protector of those who travelled by sea and, less 
                    surprisingly, courtesans and prostitutes. The goddess' Roman 
                    equivalent was Venus.</p>
