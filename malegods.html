        <h1>The Male Gods</h1>
        <div class="male">
            <div class="zeus">
                <h2>Zeus</h2>
                <p>Zeus was the king of the Olympian gods and the supreme 
                    deity in Greek religion. Often referred to as the Father, 
                    as the god of thunder and the 'cloud-gatherer', he 
                    controlled the weather, offered signs and omens and 
                    generally dispensed justice, guaranteeing order amongst 
                    both the gods and humanity from his seat high on Mt. Olympus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="apollo">
                <h2>Apollo</h2>
                <p>Apollo was a major Greek god who was associated with the bow, 
                    music, and divination. The epitome of youth and beauty, 
                    source of life and healing, patron of the civilized arts, 
                    and as bright and powerful as the sun itself, Apollo was, 
                    arguably, the most loved of all the Greek gods. He was 
                    particularly worshipped at Delphi and Delos, amongst the 
                    most famous of all religious sanctuaries in the Greek world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poseidon">
                <h2>Poseidon</h2>
                <p>God of the sea and rivers, creator of storms and floods, and 
                    the bringer of earthquakes and destruction, Poseidon was 
                    perhaps the most disruptive of all the ancient Greek gods, 
                    not only for mortals but also to Zeus' peaceful reign on 
                    Mount Olympus. Despite the above, the trident-bearing god 
                    was not always a negative force, and he did have a role as 
                    a protector, particularly to mariners, and as the patron of 
                    \horses and horse breeding. To the Romans, he was known as 
                    Neptunus or Neptune.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ares">
                <h2>Ares</h2>
                <p>Ares was the Greek god of war and perhaps the most unpopular 
                    of all the Olympian gods because of his quick temper, 
                    aggressiveness, and unquenchable thirst for conflict. He 
                    famously seduced Aphrodite, unsuccessfully fought with 
                    Hercules, and enraged Poseidon by killing his son Halirrhothios. 
                    One of the more human Olympian gods, he was a popular subject 
                    in Greek art and even more so in Roman times when he took on a 
                    \much more serious aspect as Mars, the Roman god of war.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dionysos">
                <h2>Dionysos</h2>
                <p>Dionysos (Roman name: Bacchus, also known as Dionysus) was the 
                    ancient Greek god of wine, merriment, and theatre. Being the 
                    bad boy of Mt. Olympus, he was perhaps the most colourful of 
                    the Olympian Gods..</p>
            </div>
            <div class= "hermes">
                <h2>Hermes</h2>
                <p>Hermes was the ancient Greek god of trade, wealth, luck, 
                    fertility, animal husbandry, sleep, language, thieves, and 
                    travel. One of the cleverest and most mischievous of the 
                    Olympian gods, he was the patron of shepherds, invented the 
                    lyre, and was, above all, the herald and messenger of Mt. 
                    Olympus so that he came to symbolise the crossing of boundaries 
                    in his role as a guide between the two realms of gods and 
                    humanity. To the Romans, the god was known as Mercury.   </p>

            <div class="hephaistos">
                <h2>Hephaistos</h2>
                <p>Ancient Greek god of fire, metallurgy, and crafts, Hephaistos 
                    (Hephaestus) was the brilliant blacksmith of the Olympian gods, 
                    for whom he fashioned magnificent houses, armour, and ingenious 
                    devices. Hephaistos had his workshop beneath volcanos - Mount 
                    Etna on Sicily being a favourite haunt - and was, with his lame 
                    oot, unique as the only less-than-perfect god. To the Romans, 
                    he was known as Vulcan or Volcanus.</p>
